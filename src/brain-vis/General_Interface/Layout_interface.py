It also counts<br> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br> the version number 2.1.]<br><br> Preamble<br><br> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br><br> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You<br>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br><br> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>these things.<br><br> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br><br> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is<br>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>introduced by others.<br><br> Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>libraries into non-free programs.<br><br> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary<br>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>the library.<br><br> We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<br>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less<br>of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages<br>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>special circumstances.<br><br> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>system.<br><br> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>that program using a modified version of the Library.<br><br> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The<br>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>be combined with the library in order to run.<br><br> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<br>Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br> A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br><br> The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br>which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the<br>Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br><br> &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>and installation of the library.<br><br> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>and what the program that uses the Library does.<br><br> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>Library.<br><br> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>fee.<br><br> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br> a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br><br> b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br> stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br> c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br> charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br> d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br> table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br> the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br> is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br> in the event an application does not supply such function or<br> table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br> its purpose remains meaningful.<br><br> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br> a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br> application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br> application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br> be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br> root function must still compute square roots.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Library.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>these notices.<br><br> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br><br> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>the Library into a program that is not a library.<br><br> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>medium customarily used for software interchange.<br><br> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a<br>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br><br> However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br>library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br><br> When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br><br> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br> 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>of these things:<br><br> a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br> machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br> changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br> Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br> with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br> uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br> user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br> executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br> that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br> Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br> to use the modified definitions.)<br><br> b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br> Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br> copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br> rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br> will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br> the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br> interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br><br> c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br> least three years, to give the same user the materials<br> specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br> than the cost of performing this distribution.<br><br> d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br> from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br> specified materials from the same place.<br><br> e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br> materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br> For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br>Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>the executable.<br><br> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>distribute.<br><br> 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br> based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br> facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br> Sections above.<br><br> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br> that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br> where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Library or works based on it.<br><br> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>this License.<br><br> 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>written in the body of this License.<br><br> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>the Free Software Foundation.<br><br> 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>and reuse of software generally.<br><br> NO WARRANTY<br><br> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.

You can do so by permitting<br>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>ordinary General Public License).<br><br> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br> <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author><br><br> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br> modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br> License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br> version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br> This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br> but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br> MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
